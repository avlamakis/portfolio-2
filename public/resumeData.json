    "bio":"HI! My name is Alexandros Vlamakis. I currently am a Relationship Banker with Wells Fargo Bank where I have been for 5 years now. I hold the following licenses: Series 7, Series 66, SIE, and Life Insurance. I currently attend the University of Utah's Coding Boot-camp. I am wanting to switch career paths into the Technology world as everything is becoming more advanced. I see great opportunity for growth within this field; primarily as either a front end or back end developer. I believe that as Technology advances being within these roles will allow me to help a wider group of individuals or companies with more complex issues that they may or may not understand.",
